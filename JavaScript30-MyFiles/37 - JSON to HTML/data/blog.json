Previously, I had to look up what exactly ECMA Script was, as I had always known it by its more common name, JavaScript.</p><p>The course is provided by Wes Bos, a developer and mentor who provided the free JavaScript30 course <a href='https://javascript30.com/'>avalable here</a>. I suspect the reasoning for this was to get more developers to try his teaching method and increase the numbers of Premium Courses purchased. I found it to be one of the best online tutorials I have ever come across and, when his premium courses went on sale, I bought his Node, React and ES6 courses.</p><p>I had alwas wanted to try Node and React, as a way to get back into the pathway of full stack developer, but had not thought much of ES6. Infact, apart from a few mentions online, I had never really heard of it before</p><p>Initially, I thought there was no need to study the first lessons on let and const as I had encountered these before in JavaScript 30. What I did not know were the subtle differences they bring to JavaScript and how to utilise these to write more stable code. </p>"
